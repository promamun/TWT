                                <p>Due to my childhood experiences, I developed a keen sense of words and how words connect or disconnect people. As a child I was bullied, talked poorly of, and often the source of ridicule. I often stood alone and aloof, watching how people interacted with each other. Many times that interaction was about obedience, discipline, and control – in both kids and adults alike.</p>
                                <p>What I saw was communication that was about breaking down instead of building up. The idea of nurturing one another was a topic or way of being that hadn’t even been thought of yet.</p>
